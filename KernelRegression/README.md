# Toy Kernel Regression

Packages required: Numpy, Plotly <br>
How to run: $ python main.py <br>
<br>
## Description:<br>
One of the most basic regressions known is a Kernel Regression. <br>
The predition for an unknown point x is simply a weighted sum of the values of all known points. <br>
The weights are decided by the distance from each point to x, pushed through a kernel. <br>
In the image below the seen points are in red, the kernel prediction for unknown points in green. The code to actually make the predictions is very short. The figure was generated with plotly. <br>
