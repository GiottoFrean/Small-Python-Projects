# Simple Naive Bayes

Packages required: Numpy <br>
How to run: $ python main.py <br>
<br>
## Description:<br>

This is a simple naive bayes classifer, trained on a toy problem: <br>
* The weather (W) is either sunny (s), rainy (r) or cloudy (c).
* The temperature (T) is a continous normal distribution.
* The rough frequency of people wearing raincoats (R) is recorded; none (n), few (f), lots (l) or all (a).
* T and R are conditionally independent given W.
This is represented by the diagram below: <br>
