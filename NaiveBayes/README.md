Packages required: Numpy <br>
How to run: $ python main.py <br>
<br>
## Description:<br>

This is a simple naive bayes classifer, trained on a toy problem: <br>
* The weather (W) is either sunny, rainy or cloudy.
* The temperature (T) is a continous variable.
* The rough frequency of people wearing raincoats (R) is recorded; none, few, lots or all.
* T and R are conditionally independent given W.
This is represented by the diagram below: <br>
